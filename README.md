## Introduction

Conveyor belt systems are critical in industrial operations. However, faults such as tears, cracks, and thickness degradation can cause significant production losses and safety risks. This project integrates computer vision, ultrasonic sensors, and AI models to detect and diagnose these issues in real time.
